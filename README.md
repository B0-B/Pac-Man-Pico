## About
This project is dedicated to the original 1980's maze action video game Pac-Man with the aim to build a simulative toy engine in vanilla javascript in the most compact size possible. 

Original game support on modern x86 architecture offers pacman in actronomically large sizes. Especially when it comes to emulation and booting on single board systems (e.g. for a DIY arcade machine) size begins to matter, in terms of storage and performance. The table below shows the comparison of minimum storage requirements accross different systems

|System|Distribution|Minimum Storage Size [Bytes]|

## Playground

If the "resolution" variable is decreased (actually the block size) from 40 to 20 pixels, the maze can be condensed to a larger maze in total but in persistent bounds.
It might be necessary to adjust the velocities, or window geometry as well.
